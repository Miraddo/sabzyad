# Cookie policy

This page explains how cookies and local storage are used on Sabzyad.

## 1. What is a cookie?
A cookie is a small file stored in the browser to enable better functionality, personalization, or usage analytics.

## 2. Types of cookies / storage we use
| Type | Purpose | Examples |
|-----|---------|----------|
| Necessary | Required for basic site functionality | Language, dark mode, session token (if added) |
| Performance/Analytics (optional) | Improve experience with anonymous statistics | Page views (future) |
| User preferences | Remember your choices | Course progress, focus mode |

## 3. Local storage (localStorage)
We use localStorage to keep lesson progress and some UX settings. This data stays only on your device.

## 4. Managing cookies
You can:
- Use the consent banner to accept or decline optional cookies.
- Clear cookies from your browser settings.
- Use private browsing to avoid persistence.

## 5. Future changes
If we add analytics tools (like self-hosted Plausible or Matomo), we'll ask for consent before enabling and update this page accordingly.
